  storyText: "You ready yourself for the attack. You sneak in the cave, raise your
    sword and stab the sleeping bear. The bear is wounded but she's awake and angry
    as all hell. She attacks with the flurry of swipes. Luckily your shield protects
    you, but it's broken in the process. Your next move is: \r\n\r\n1.Attack her
    again\r\n2.Run North"
